Hey! Some quick info on what I've done since we last saw each other.

I finished my part! The ultrasonic localization should work properly, though i find the falling edge works 
better than the rising edge. You an retest it as you run your part if you want!
I still have to comment my classes though...


I added the part in the Lab4 class to create and start a light localizer from your class 
You just have to press any button s after the ultrasonic localization is over and you should
see the light sensor turn on and your program start after a while

I haven't really tested your class so I don't know if it works.
If it works, great! Just comment it and we're good for the demo 

If not, I'm pretty sure you could do something simpler like turning 45 degrees after the end
of ultrasonic localization, going forward until you see a line and then turn back 
either to the original position or until you see another line.
Also, try to use a differential filter instead of a threshold as we might have to demo on the blue tiles in the other room

Other than that, it's looking good
It would be great if we could meet to explain each other our part and run some final tests before the demo on monday!
