/**
 * This is the class used to perform the ultrasonic localization of our robot.
 * It implements both the rising edge and falling edge type.
 * At the end of this part, the robot should be facing almost zero degrees.
 * It runs in a thread
 * 
 * {@value #MAX_DISTANCE} Constant. Maximum distance used to detect when there is no wall in the filter for the falling edge type
 * {@value #SMALL_DISTANCE} Constant. Used in the filter for the rising edge type, helps to remove false negatives better than a higher value
 * {@value #WALL_DISTANCE} Constant. Value under which the robot is assumed to be facing a wall
 * {@value #MARGIN_DIsTANCE} Constant. Value used to remove noise when detecting the edge of the wall
 * {@value #FILTER_OUT} Constant. Number of constant large values we need in a row before considering a value to be actually large in our filter
 * {@value #filterControl} Class variable to be incremented in our filter to remove false negatives
 * {@value #lastDistance} Class variable used in our filter to keep track of the last distance returned by the ultrasonic sensor
 * {@value #locType} Class variable. Localization type that needs to be specified when an instance of the class is created
